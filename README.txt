Hi, welcome to our final project.

This is the work of Rahul Bharadwaj, Warren Mardoum, and Pooneh Safayenikoo.

We have 4 implementations here of a fully connected network, and one implementation of a convolutional
neural network.

We have a fully connected network in Python, MATLAB, and Java. We have a convolutional
network (just for fun) in MATLAB.

Each implementation is in their own folder, and has the necessary files to run. 

For the Java Implementation:
You would need to run the Main.java file, with all the other files in the project folder.

For the MATLAB Implementation:
To run just the fully connected network, have the fc.m file with the getCmatrix.m file and the
mnist.mat file, and run the fc.m file.

To run the convolutional neural network, get the mnist2.mat file and the getCmatrix file,
and run the covFC.m file.

For the Python Implementation and the PyTorch implementation, there is only one file each
respectively, all you would need to do is run those files, since MNIST is already built into
Python libraries.
